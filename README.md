<p>Hello everyone! My name is Lai Huynh Nhat Minh, and I am a developer from Vietnam, specializing in website development. My journey into software development began towards the end of 2022. After earning my degree from the Kyushu Institute of Information Science (<a href="https://www.kiis.ac.jp/en/">KIIS</a>) in March 2022, I faced challenges finding a job in Japan related to my field of study and consequently returned to Vietnam. Fortunately, upon my return, I landed an internship in my hometown of Da Nang. During this internship, I was trained as an Angular developer and this had left me fallen in love with the development process and specifically Angular</p>
