<p align="center">Love anything technology related. Currently working as a fullstack developer (NestJS and Angular, NextJS).</p>

<p>Hello everyone! My name is Lai Huynh Nhat Minh, and I am a developer from Vietnam, specializing in website development. My journey into software development began towards the end of 2022. After earning my degree from the Kyushu Institute of Information Science (<a href="https://www.kiis.ac.jp/en/">KIIS</a>) in March 2022, I faced challenges finding a job in Japan related to my field of study and consequently returned to Vietnam. Fortunately, upon my return, I landed an internship in my hometown of Da Nang. During this internship, I was trained as an Angular developer and this had left me fallen in love with the development process and specifically Angular</p>

- ðŸŒŸ Speak fluent Vietnamese and English. N2 in Japanese.
- ðŸš€ Angular enthusiast. Love NestJS and Angular.
- ðŸš€ React developer. I enjoy working with React (sometimes Vue)
- ðŸŸ© Currently learning Golang + HTMX stack as a way to improve my skills and just to broaden my perspective.
- ðŸ“° Hopefully will deploy own portfolio website sometimes soon.
